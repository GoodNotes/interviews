### Case study recording

### Instructions

* We'll invite candidates to record a case study walkthrough video. The video is expected to be *20* *minutes in duration*.
* You DON’T have to edit out your stutters or add any motion graphic. Just a plain recording in your pajamas will do.
* You can submit your video recording here (https://airtable.com/shr2eaeRTGbYJBI5e), along with your case study slides in PDF format.
* If you are having trouble uploading the video, you can paste a private Youtube link (https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/157177?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en), a Google Drive link (https://support.google.com/drive/answer/2494822?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en), or a Loom link (https://www.loom.com/) in the “Others” section.

### Why we ask for a pre-recorded presentation

1. It helps establish a shared understanding of your work between you and our interviewers ahead of the first interview.
2. It allows us to ask more informed questions about your experience and work during the interview process.
3. Generally, we avoid using meetings as a means to present. Instead, we record or type our thoughts and use meetings as Q&A. This exercise provides you with an opportunity to experience this style of work.

### Presentation Topics 

1. A short self-introduction, and a high-level overview of one of your work.
2. We want to understand:
    1. the goals of the project
    2. structure of the team you were a part of
    3. what you personally did on the project
    4. your process and methodology
    5. the challenges you faced, and how you approached them
    6. how you synthesized research data to inform product and design decisions
    7. the final output and its impact on the business and to the users
    8. your reflections and lessons learned
