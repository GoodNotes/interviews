GoodNotes - Take-Home Challenge for Digital Marketing Roles
===
This is a challenge to evaluate candidates interested in joining the GoodNotes team. It is meant to be fun and short (<4 hrs) and serve as a way for the team to understand your approach in tackling problems. 

### Assignment

You're asked to outline a *go-to-market strategy* and elaborate on the tactics. The product is... YOU! The target audience for this product is the team behind GoodNotes who's actively looking to hire a new Digital Marketing Manager.

You're free to choose the format in which you want to deliver your take-home assignment and we encourage creativity and hope you'll surprise us. Nevertheless, here are a few points that you should consider covering in the approach:

* What are the unique selling points and the value proposition of the product?
* How do you position the product against other products in the same category?
* Which channels would you use to promote the product?
* Ideas for marketing campaigns you have to promote the product.
* How you measure success
