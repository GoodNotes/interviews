GoodNotes - Take-Home Challenge for Community Manager Roles
===
This is a challenge to evaluate candidates interested in joining the GoodNotes team. It is meant to be fun (<4 hrs) and serve as a way for the team to gain more insight about you as a Community Manager candidate.  

### Assignment

You're asked to create a fictional social media profile (feel free to chose the most suitable channel yourself) and curate something on there.  Please also write one page to talk about your rationales behind picking the content and the approach you took. 

We are not expecting you to create all the content yourselves. You can select it from elsewhere as well if you want as long as it is sufficient to show your creativity, taste, communication skills and social media affinity.  

### Grading & Submission
Please share the one page summary (with the public account link) [here](https://airtable.com/shr2eaeRTGbYJBI5e).
