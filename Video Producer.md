Video ContentProducer Take Home Challenge
===
This is a challenge to evaluate candidates interested in joining the GoodNotes team. It is meant to be fun and short (<4 hrs)
and serve as a way for the team to understand your approach in tackling problems.

### Challenge
You’re asked to produce a 1-2 minute video about one of the three following topics:
1) What’s your video production process?
2) What’s on my desk - video producer edition. A showcase of your equipment and production set up.
3) A product I love

Show us your creativity. It is completely up to you what kind of video you’re making. If you feel stuck, take a look at the
examples of videos we’re expecting to produce at GoodNotes. But please keep in mind not to spend longer than 4 hours in
total on the take home challenge. We don’t want to steal too much of your time, and we also want to see what you can
come up with when there is only a limited time available.

### What we’re looking for and how your assignment will be graded

Please read carefully before starting the challenge!

Unless you can tell a really thrilling story, a simple screen recording is likely not enough for us to get an understanding of
how you work.

Good luck and have fun!
