===
Below, you will find a list of cases that Office Administrator might be facing on a regular basis.  Please read through the cases carefully.  Some cases require you to formulate a reply that you would send over to a partner via email.  For other cases, we’d like to see your solution and a short explanation of your thinking process.  

You should not take more than 3 hours to complete the assignment.

#### Tips to master the take home assignment
* Read through the cases carefully
* Stay open-minded - there are no right or wrong answers.
* Try to think outside of the box.  Just because a solution is not common doesn’t mean that it is wrong.
