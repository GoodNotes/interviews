GoodNotes - Design Take-Home Challenge
===
This is a design challenge to evaluate candidates interested in joining the team at GoodNotes. It is meant to be short (<4 hrs) and serve as a way for us to understand your approach on product design.

### Introduction

The Calculator app has been around since the first  smart phones. Generally, it provides basic functionality of a calculator but it wasn't targeted for a specific vertical. How would you re-design the calculator app to make it work better for you as a designer?

### Deliverable
Design a calculator application targeted for user interface / graphic designers. You could assume the final application to be used on any modern mobile devices.

We expect a description of your solution, with any sketches or wireframes that were used to arrive at your design. Any sketches of rejected ideas would also be useful to show your thought process. Please include at least one high fidelity UI mockup showing the important pieces of your solution.

### Grading & Submission
You'll be graded based on creativity, story telling, and general product design capability. Please [email our designer Rodney](mailto:rodney@goodnotes.com?subject=GoodNotes) your submission in PDF format along with your design files in the respective format (PSD, Sketech, etc).
