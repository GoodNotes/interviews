GoodNotes - Take-Home Challenge for Design Roles
===
This is a design challenge to evaluate candidates interested in joining the GoodNotes team. It is meant to be short (<4 hrs) and serve as a way for the team to understand your approach on product design. This exercise is purely for hiring purpose, and will not be used in the product.

### Introduction
The Calculator app has been around since the first smart phones. Generally, it provides basic functionality of a calculator but it wasn't targeted for a specific vertical. How would you re-design the calculator app to make it work better for you as a designer?

### Deliverable
Design a calculator application targeted for user interface / graphic designers. You could assume the final application to be used on any modern mobile devices.

We expect a detailed description of your solution, with any materials or wireframes that were used to arrive at your design. Any sketches of rejected ideas would also be useful to show your thought process. 

Please include just one polished high-fidelity UI mockup showing the most important pieces of your solution. You are not required to produce more high-fidelity mockups or prototype, as we hope you could spend more time in problem discovery and solution ideation.

### Grading & Submission
You'll be graded based on your critical thinking skills, creativity, story telling, and general product design capability. Itâ€™s okay to come up with interesting ideas that slightly deviate from the brief, as long as you provide a convincing rationale.

Please submit your assignment [here](https://airtable.com/shr2eaeRTGbYJBI5e) in PDF format along with your design files in the respective format (Sketch, Figma, PSD, etc). Indicate your total time spent doing the assignment in the PDF.
