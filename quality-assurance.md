GoodNotes - Quality Assurance Take-home Challenge
===

### Introduction

You’re joining a software company that is developing a basic but [worldwide popular calculator app](https://apps.apple.com/app/calculator/id1069511488) for iOS devices. As the companies only QA person, it is your job to make sure that the app and every update to it fulfills the standards for quality before it is shipped to the App Store. Users heavily rely on the calculator app on a daily basis and small bugs in the core functionality can cause a lot of harm.

### Requirements

The product manager and the design lead provide you with the following **requirements** for the calculator app:
* the app needs to run on all iOS devices using iOS 9 or higher
* the app allows users to do 4 basic calculations:
    * Addition
    * Subtraction
    * Multiplication
    * Division
* The app supports decimals
* The app allows users to calculate with negative and positive algebraic signs
* The app allows users to clear the entry
    * Users can clear the current entry and preserve the memory (previous entries)
    * Users can clear the current entry and also clear the memory from previous entries
* The app lets users convert any entry from percentage into a decimal number (divide by 100)
* The app allows users to copy the entry
* Users can see which operator (+ - x ÷) is currently selected

*Hint: the requirements may not be complete, so consider cases that could have been left out.*

### Deliverable

1. You are asked to **create a high-level test plan** for the calculator app
2. Write the **necessary test cases** that will allow your team to ship an update to the calculator app to the App Store with the necessary confidence.
