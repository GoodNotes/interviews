GoodNotes - Challenge for Product Designer Roles Post-Ideation Interview Session
===

### Creating an ice-breaking app for students

* This is a design challenge to evaluate candidates after passing the on-site ideation session, please note that you only need to work on it if you are asked to do so by the internal recruiters/ interviewers. This is meant to be short and serves as a way for the team to understand your approach to product design. This exercise is purely for hiring purposes, and will not be used in the product.

### Contextual and technical constraints

* The app focuses on high-school students in the United States
* Students are all filling in their information during class time. approximately 15 mins
* There is a teacher in the class to answer any question 
* The max characters for each question are 40 words max
* The max characters for each answer (if it is a text field) is 100 words max
* There is another LMS App where the teacher is the moderator and work as an admin
* Students do not have to answer all of the questions 
* It should be usable in both physical classrooms or remote learning settings
* There may be ethnic minorities and physically challenged students

### Deliverables

* Extend on your progress from the previous session. You should assume your solution to work on a mobile device of your choice.
* We expect a detailed description of your solution, with any materials, wireframes, or flowcharts that were used to arrive at your design. Any sketches of rejected ideas would also be useful to show your thought process.

* Please include 2 to 3 screens of polished high-fidelity UI mockup showing the most important pieces of your solution. You are not required to produce any more, as we hope you could spend more time in solution ideation and craftsmanship.

### Grading & Submission

* Your design should reflect the following qualities: Intuitive, Efficient, Simple, Consistent, and Delightful.
* You'll be graded based on your strategic creativity, craftsmanship, presentation, and general product design skills. Itâ€™s okay to come up with interesting ideas that slightly deviate from the brief or the ideation session, as long as you provide a convincing rationale.
* Submit your assignment here (https://airtable.com/shr2eaeRTGbYJBI5e) in PDF along with your design files in the respective format (Sketch, Figma, PSD, etc). Please include a breakdown of your time spent in the PDF.
* You should not spend more than 3 hours doing this exercise. Feel free to share your thoughts on what you could have been done if given more time.
