GoodNotes - Take-Home Challenge for Office Manager Roles
===
Below, you will find a list of cases that Office Manager might be facing on a regular basis. It is meant to be short (<3 hrs) and serve as a way for the team to understand your approach on customer support.

### INSTRUCTIONS

 Please read through the cases carefully.  Some cases require you to formulate a reply that you would send over to a partner via email.  For other cases, we’d like to see your solution and a short explanation of your thinking process.  

You should not take more than 3 hours to complete the assignment.

### Tips to master the take home assignment
* Read through the cases carefully
* Stay open-minded - there're no right or wrong answers.
* Try to think outside of the box.  Just because a solution is not common doesn’t mean that it is wrong.
    

*Hygiene of the toilets*

Some people in the office have complained that the toilets are always very dirty, with liquid on the seat of the toilet and on the ground, the situation did not improve at all even though you have already reminded the team several times on Slack to keep the toilets clean.  How would you handle this issue that is happening repeatedly?  

*Company birthday celebration*

Next Thursday you’re celebrating your company’s 11th birthday. Your company has too few employees to be able to talk over dinner so people have suggested drinks and light snacks. Make a suggestion for a place and time and explain what special preparations you’d make.

*How to prioritise your day*

Now its’ 9am, imagine you have the following tasks to complete today. Explain how you would prioritize them and why:

* *Reply to an employee in Slack who is asking you about ways to claim insurance.*
* *Restock the medical kit of office.*
* *Restock the coffee bean, the founder is a big fan of coffee*
* *Source for vendors to fix the water leakage problem in the main meeting room.*
* *Book tickets and hotel for four employees going to an important and popular conference in San Francisco next week.*
* *Share employee information with travel agent for the offsite trip, as the deadline is today.*
* *Seek three offers for our Christmas party, which is taking place on the 23rd and is a rather busy day for corporate events in the specific venues we are targeting.*
* *Order work equipment for a new hire who is starting in two days time.*
* *Prepare a the IR56F document for an ex-employee who has left the company 2 weeks ago.*
* *Order roll-up banners which need to be printed and shipped by next week for an event we are sponsoring.*


*Business Partner Office Visit*

An overseas business partner is coming to your office for a meeting with the founder. This partner has never met the founder and has never been to Hong Kong or your office.

1. Please draft the Google Calendar invitation and take a screenshot.
2. Please draft a meeting confirmation email you would send them.  You can include all the information that you believe they need to have a pleasant stay.
3.  What would you add if the founder instructed you to go the extra mile for their arrangements?

*HR Tool Research*

We are a team of 13 (11 onsite in Hong Kong, 2 working remotely), draft a comparison table with 3 HR tools that we can consider using to help us run our payroll smoothly.  Requested features: pay leaves management, personal information management.
