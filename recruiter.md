GoodNotes - Take-Home Challenge for Recruiter Roles
===
This is a challenge to evaluate candidates interested in joining the GoodNotes team. It is meant to be short (<4 hrs) and serve as a way for the team to understand your approach in attracting candidates. 

### Tip to master the take home assignment

Try to think from the candidate leads perspective to decide on what to and not to include

### Deliverable
Create a recruitment presentation for your favourite company to help them recruit growth engineers.  Through this deck, we hope to

1) get an overview of the company product/ services and culture
2) be convinced to apply to the company 

We might ask you to go through the presentation with us.  The entire presentation should be 5-10 minutes long, supported by a deck, and allowing around 15 minutes for questions. We don’t expect you to put in more than 4 hours into preparing and creating the deck.

We know that the company you are working/ worked at might be your favourite but we would love see your research skills, so please choose some other companies for the deck.  

### Grading & Submission
You’ll be graded on presentation skills, research skills, work culture sensitivity, prioritisation skills and audience-oriented mindset.  Please submit your assignment [here](https://airtable.com/shr2eaeRTGbYJBI5e). We may or may not arrange a time for presentation upon receiving the deck.
